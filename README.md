Simple Websocket client and server
===

Simple and easy to use Websocket client and server.

## Presentation :

This is a node.js fast and simple implementation of websocket client and server.

## Intention :

Other node.js projects exist regarding websockets but unless we did not look well, we could not find something minimal with the basic encode/decode functions for websockets implemented over a simple TCP server and client socket including the initial handshake.

## Implementation :

See lib/websocket.js
There is no installation instruction because it's quite easy to install, it has been built with pieces from different projects (see below), everything is minimal and simple, if you don't like some functions or it does not correspond to your use just replace or modify them.
Of course the client can be a normal browser.

## Tests :

Not everything has been tested, only the fact that client/server work between each other and from outside sources (browsers)
